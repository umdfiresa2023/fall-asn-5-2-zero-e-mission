In this assignment, you will learn to run and interpret regression results in Table 2 Panel A in *Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program* by Deschênes et al. (2017).

### **Part 1. Understanding the Methodology**

In the first part of this assignment, you will need to read **Section IV. Econometric Model** (pages 2969 - 2970) in the paper by Deschênes et al. (2017). You can find a copy of the paper in **paper.pdf**. Afterward, you will need to answer the questions below.

We will focus on the regression equation

$$
Y_{cst} = \gamma_1 1(NBP Operating)_{cst} + W'_{cst}\beta+\mu_{ct}+\eta_{st}+\nu_{cs}+\epsilon_{cst}
$$

where $cst$ represents the unit of each observation in the data. In this assignment, we will focus on the case where the outcome variable, $Y_{cst}$ is NOx, SO2, and CO2 emissions.

#### Question 1: What is the unit of each observation in the data? (3 points)

Hint: You learned about data units in Week 9 class.

Answer: county-season-year

#### The variable $NBPOperating_{cst}$ is a product of three dummy variables, $post_t \times nbp_c \times smm_s$.

#### $nbp_c$ is a dummy variable for NBP participating counties.

#### $smm_s$ is a dummy variable for the summer season.

#### Question 2: What does the variable *post* represent? Why is *post* equal to 0.5 in the year 2003? (2 points)

Answer: Because 8 states plus Washington D.C. started participating in 2003, while the other 11 NBP states started participating in 2004.

#### Question 3: What does the parameter of interest $\gamma_1$ represent? (1 point)

Answer: The impact of NBP in regulated counties on summer emissions after its operation relative to non-NBP states.

**Question 4: The variable** $\mu_{ct}$ **represents county-year fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer: Local economic activity of a county can impact the outcome.

**Question 5: The variable** $\eta_{st}$ **represents season-year fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer: Factors common to a season and year can be controlled. For example, a new drug may be developed in all states.

**Question 6: The variable** $\nu_{ct}$ **represents county-year fixed effects. Why do we have to include this factor in our analysis? (1 point)**

Answer: Permanent differences in outcomes across states may impact the outcome. For example, additional year-round NOx regulations were in place for Massachusetts in 2004.

### Part 2. Preparing the Data

#### Step 1: Declare that you will use the *tidyverse* and *lfe* package. (4 points)

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("lfe")
```

#### Step 2: Upload *data.csv* into the Environment. (2 point)

```{r}
df<-read.csv("data.csv")
```

#### Step 3: Create a new variable called ***post*** that is equal to 0.5 in the year 2003 and equal to 1 in the years 2004 through 2007. Otherwise, *post* is equal to 0. (6 points)

```{r}
df2<-df %>%
  mutate(post=ifelse(year>=2004,1,0)) %>%
  mutate(post=ifelse(year==2003,0.5,post))

```

#### Step 4: The variable *fips* are county indicators. The script below creates a unique identifier for each county-season which will be used to represent $\nu_{cs}$ in the regressions.

#### You need to create another unique identifier for each season-year which will be used to represent $\eta_{ct}$ in the regressions. Name the new variable *smmXy*. (2 point)

```{r}
df3<-df2 %>%
  mutate(smmXc = smm*as.numeric(fips)) %>%
  mutate(smmXy = smm*year)
```

#### Step 5: The script below creates a unique identifier for each state and year. Use the same method to create a unique identifier for each county-year. Name the new variable *cXy*. (2 point)

```{r}
df4<-df3 %>%
  mutate(stXy = paste(state, "-", as.character(year))) %>%
  mutate(cXy = paste(fips, "-", as.character(year))) 
```

#### Step 6: Create a new variable that represents the variable $NBPOperating_{cst}$. Name the new variable ***NBPOperating*****. (2 point)**

Hint: We discussed this in Part 1 Question 1.

```{r}
df5<-df4 %>%
  mutate(NBPOperating=post*smm*nbp) 
```

### Part 3: Running the Regressions

Answer Questions 1 to 3 based on the regression results below.

```{r}
summary(m1<-lm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating, data=df5))
```

#### Question 1: According to the regression, the NOx Budget Program was able to reduce NOx emissions by \_\_0.26\_\_ thousand tons per county-season. (1 point)

#### Question 2: According to the regression, the value of $\gamma_1$ is \_\_-0.26\_\_\_\_. (1 point)

#### Question 3: Can the regression produce an accurate estimate of the NBP's impact? If not, why? (2 points)

Answer: No, because there are other factors affecting NOx emissions that we have not taken into account.

The script below adds weather controls to the regression. Answer Questions 4 to 6 based on the regression results below.

```{r}

summary(m2<-felm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating + 
                   dptp_xtile_1 + dptp_xtile_2 + dptp_xtile_4 + dptp_xtile_5 +
                   dptp_xtile_6 + dptp_xtile_7 + dptp_xtile_8 + dptp_xtile_9 +

                   tmean_xtile_11 + tmean_xtile_12 + tmean_xtile_13 + tmean_xtile_14 +
                   tmean_xtile_15 + tmean_xtile_16 + tmean_xtile_17 + tmean_xtile_18 +
                   tmean_xtile_19 + tmean_xtile_20 + mean_prcp, 
                 data=df5))

```

#### Question 4: According to the regression, the NOx Budget Program was able to reduce NOx emissions by \_\_0.39\_\_\_ thousand tons per county-season. (1 point)

#### Question 5: According to the regression, the value of $\gamma_1$ is \_\_-0.39\_\_\_\_. (1 point)

summary(c1<-felm(nox_emit ~ NBPOperating | 
                   smmXc + smmXy + stXy ,

#### Question 8: Based on the regression results in Column 1 through 5, the NOx Budget Program decreased NOx emissions in the average county by \_\_330\_\_\_\_\_\_(minimum value) to \_\_440\_\_\_\_(maximum value) tons of NOx per summer. (2 points)

#### Question 9: Because there are 1185 counties regulated by the NOx Budget Program, our results correspond to a total decrease of between \_\_391,050\_\_\_\_\_\_(minimum value) to \_521,400\_\_\_\_\_(maximum value) tons of NOx per summer. (2 points)
